***** random forest, logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machines, artificial neural
networks etc. to predict up to 93% total accuracy in the prediction of the mortality rate

1) Feature engineering :  (TF/IDF), Bag of words (BOW) and report length
   ML: 
	Logistic regression : predicts the class of numerical variable based on its relationship with the label
	Multinomial Naïve Bayes: class probabilities of a given text by using Bayes rule
        Support vector machine (SVM) :  for classifying text into different categories
	Decision trees: It splits the space recursively according to the inputs and classifies at the bottom of the 			tree
   Ensemble machine learning: 
	Bagging : avoiding overfitting . improves the performance of other classification and regression machine 			learning algorithms
	AdaBoost : It starts with having equal weights for each observation and trains a weak learning algorithm 		            using weighted data. By performing this, a weak classifier is being produced
	Random forest classifier:  By averaging predictions of all the individual regression trees, the overall 					prediction can be made.
	Stochastic gradient boosting :used for reducing the correlation between the trees in gradient boosting
